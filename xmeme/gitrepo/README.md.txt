## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package, installed in your environement.

### Node
- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

### React

Step 1: To get started, we need to open a command prompt. Hit the Windows+R keys to open a run command box. Type in ‘cmd‘ and then hit the OK button.

Step 2: Create a project folder named reactproject1:

mkdir reactproject1
Press Enter to execute the command, and we get a new directory called reactproject1. If you did this as part of the Command Prompt examples, you could skip this step as it will tell you that it already exists.

Step 3: Move to the project folder, using cd reactproject1, so we can install React into it.

cd reactproject1
At this point, you will see your prompt indicate C:\Users\ReactUser\reactproject1.

Step 4: Create a package.json file. The following command will walk you through creating a package.json file.

npm init


### SpringToolSuite

Installing STS
Step 1: Download Spring Tool Suite from https://spring.io/tools3/sts/all. Click on the platform which you are using. In this tutorial, we are using the Windows platform.
Step 2: Extract the zip file and install the STS.
sts-bundle -> sts-3.9.9.RELEASE -> Double-click on the STS.exe.
Step 3: Spring Tool Suite 3 Launcher dialog box appears on the screen. Click on the Launch button. You can change the Workspace if you want.
Step 4: It starts launching the STS.
